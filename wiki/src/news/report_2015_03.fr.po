"March was full of surprises: first Mozilla changed the release date for "
"Firefox, so the Tor team had to change the release date for the [[Tor "
"Browser|https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-406-released]], and we "
"had to change the release date of version 1.3.1. Usually, these updates are "
"a little late... but this time, it has been advanced one week earlier!"

"But then... a whole bunch of [[vulnerabilities were discovered in Firefox|"
"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/known-vulnerabilities/firefox-esr/"
"#firefoxesr31.6]], so Mozilla did an emergency release.  Due to their early "
"release, we released 1.3.1 early as well, so that we could incorporate those "
"security fixes. And the planned 1.3.1 became 1.3.2. So, instead of a release-"
"free month, we had a two-releases month!"
