[[!meta title="Install additional software"]]

Tails includes a
[[coherent but limited set of applications|doc/about/features]]. More
applications can be installed as on any Debian system. Only
applications that are packaged for Debian can be installed. To know if an application
is packaged for Debian, and to find the name of the corresponding software packages, you can search for it in the
[[Debian package directory|https://www.debian.org/distrib/packages]].

<div class="caution">

<p>The packages included in Tails are carefully tested for security.
Installing additional packages might break the security built in Tails.
Be careful with what you install.</p>

</div>

Since Tails is amnesic, any additional software package needs to be reinstalled in each working
session. To install the same software packages automatically at the beginning of every working session use the
[[<span class="guilabel">Additional software packages</span> persistence feature|doc/first_steps/persistence/configure#additional_software]] instead.

<div class="tip">

<p>Packages that use the network need to be configured to go through Tor. They are otherwise blocked from accessing the network.</p>

</div>

To install additional software packages:

1. [[Set up an administration password|doc/first_steps/startup_options/administration_password]].

2. Open a [[root terminal|doc/first_steps/startup_options/administration_password#open_root_terminal]].

3. Execute the following command to update the lists of available packages:

       apt-get update

3. To install an additional package, execute the following command, replacing
   `[package]` with the name of the package that you want to install:

       apt-get install [package]

   For example, to install the package `ikiwiki`, execute:

       apt-get install ikiwiki

   <div class="note">

   <p>You can also write multiple package names to install several packages at the same
   time. If a package has dependencies, those will be installed
   automatically.</p>
