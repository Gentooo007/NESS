<p>Most files contain metadata which is information characterising the
content of the file. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cameras record data about when and where a picture was taken and what
camera was used.</li>
<li>Office documents automatically add author
and company information to texts and spreadsheets.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use the <span
class="application"><a href="https://mat.boum.org">MAT</a></span> to
clean the metadata from your files before publishing them.</p>
