[[!meta title="Running the automated test suite on lizard"]]

The isotester1 VM on lizard is configured to run our automated test
suite. Core Tails developers can run it there, e.g. on ISO images
built by Jenkins.

[[!toc levels=2]]

# Entering the system

As a core developer, you have SSH access to `isotester1.lizard`.
The connection details you need live in our internal Git repository.

# Getting an ISO image

You can quickly retrieve ISO images built by Jenkins from
<http://nightly.tails.boum.org/>, e.g. using `wget` or `curl`.

# Running the test suite

Use `sudo su -` to enter a root session.

A clone of the Tails Git repository can be found in `/srv/git/`.

When using the `--capture` option, please pass it a filename within
`/tmp/TailsToaster`, for storage management reasons.

You can access the VNC display of the system under testing using
a SSH tunnel.
