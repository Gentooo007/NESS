[[!meta title="Build the wiki offline"]]

Here is how to build the wiki offline.

<div class="bug">

<p>The following instructions don't work as such in Tails. See
[[!tails_ticket 9018]] for a possible solution.</p>

</div>

If you have not done it before, update the list of packages known to Tails:

    sudo apt-get update

Then install the dependencies:

    sudo apt-get install libyaml-perl libyaml-libyaml-perl po4a \
    	perlmagick libyaml-syck-perl ikiwiki

Clone our main [[Git repository|git]]:

    git clone https://git-tails.immerda.ch/tails

Then run the following command, at the root of the Git folder:

    ./build-wiki

You can now browse the files in

    ./config/chroot_local-includes/usr/share/doc/tails/website/

To accelerate the build, you can disable some languages by editing the
parameter `po_slave_languages` in ikiwiki.setup.
