[[!meta title="Tails report for April, 2015"]]

This report is a bit special: since we release every 6 weeks, there is no release this month. The next one is [[planned for the 12th of May|contribute/calendar]]. Therefore there are no code news, the work being done will be reported when it's released :)

However, like any Free Software project, Tails is not only about the code, so here are the news about the other parts of the project!
