Plug first USB stick
====================

1. Plug the first USB stick into the computer.

<div class="caution">

<p>All the data on the installed device will be lost.</p>

</div>

Because *Tails Installer* is not yet available in Windows, you first
need to install a temporary Tails on a first USB stick using a different
program called *Universal USB Installer*. On this temporary Tails you
won't benefit from important features like automatic upgrades or the
possibility of storing some of your personal files. After starting on
this temporary Tails, you will be able to install a second full-featured
Tails USB stick using *Tails Installer*.

Copy ISO image on first USB stick
=================================

1. Download <span class="application">Universal USB Installer</span>:

   <a class='download-file' href=https://tails.boum.org/Universal-USB-Installer.exe>Universal USB Installer</a>

1. At the Windows security warning, click **Run** to run *Universal USB
Installer* without saving it.

1. If a second security warning appears, also confirm that you want to
run the program.

1. Read the licence agreement and click **I Agree** to continue and
start <span class="application">Universal USB Installer</span>.

   [[!img /doc/first_steps/installation/manual/windows/04-select-tails.png link=no alt="screenshot of Universal USB Installer"]]

1. Select **Tails** from the drop-down list.

1. Click **Browse** and choose the ISO image that you downloaded earlier.

1. Use the drop-down list to specify the USB stick on which you want to copy
the ISO image.

1. Click **Create**.

1. A confirmation dialog appears. Click **Yes** to start the installation.

1. After the installation is finished, click **Close** to quit *Universal USB
Installer*.

You will now use this first USB stick as a temporary Tails to be able to
install Tails on the second USB stick using *Tails Installer*.

Restart on first USB stick
==========================

1. To be able to follow the rest of the instructions after shutting down
your computer, we recommend you either:

   - Open this page from your smartphone (recommended).
   - Print the rest of the instructions on paper.
   - Write down the URL of this page to be able to come back later:</br>
     <https://tails.boum.org/install/win/usb/4-restart-temporary>.

1. Shut down your computer while leaving the first USB stick plugged in.

1. Switch on your computer.

   - If your computer starts on Tails, the **Boot Tails** screen
     appears. Choose **Live** and press **Enter**.

     [[!img boot-menu.png link=no alt="Black screen with Tails artwork. 'Boot menu' with two options 'Live' and 'Live (failsafe)'."]]

   - If your computer starts on your usual operating system, refer to
     the troubleshooting section [[Tails does not start at all|windows#at_all]].

1. After 30 seconds to 60 seconds, another screen, called *Tails
Greeter* appears.

   [[!img doc/first_steps/startup_options/tails-greeter-welcome-to-tails.png link=no]]

   - If your computer stops responding or displays error messages before
     getting to *Tails Greeter*, refer to the troubleshooting section
     [[Tails does not start entirely|windows#not_entirely]].

1. In *Tails Greeter*, select your preferred language in the drop-down
list on the bottom left of the screen.

1. Click **Login**.

1. After 15 seconds to 30 seconds, the Tails desktop appears.

Troubleshooting: Tails does not start at all
--------------------------------------------

The following section applies if the **Boot Tails** menu does not
appears when starting Tails.

It is quite common for computers not to start automatically on a Tails
USB stick. Here are few troubleshooting techniques that you should try
one after the other.

### Getting to the boot menu

On most computer, you can press a *boot menu key* to display a list of possible
devices to start from. The following screenshot is an example of such boot
menu:

[[!img boot_menu.png link=no]]

This section explains how to identify the correct boot menu key on your
computer and how to use it to start Tails.

1. Identify the potential boot menu keys for your computer depending on
your computer manufacturer in the following list:

   <table>
   <tr><th>Manufacturer</th><th>Type</th><th>Models</th><th>Key</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
   <tr><td>Acer</td><td>*</td><td>*</td><td>Esc, F12, F9</td></tr>

   </table>

1. Make sure the first USB stick is plugged into the computer.

1. Shut down your computer.

1. Hold down the first potential boot menu key identified in step 1
while you switch on your computer.

   - If a boot menu with a list of possible devices to start from
     appears, then select your first USB stick.

   - If you computer starts on your usual operating system, repeat steps
     2 and 3 for all the potential boot menu keys identified in step 1.

### Edit the BIOS settings

If you cannot get to the boot menu, you might need to edit your BIOS
settings. Consult your computer manual on how to enter the BIOS
settings.

In the BIOS settings, try to apply the following changes one by one and
restart between each one of them. Some changes might not apply to your
computer model.

1. Edit the **Boot Order**. Depending on your computer model you should
see an entry for **removable drive** or **USB media**. Move this entry
to the top of the list to force your computer to attempt to start from
your device before starting from the internal hard disk. Save your
changes and restart.

1. Disable **Fast boot**.

1. If the computer is configured to start with **legacy BIOS**, try to
configure it to start with **UEFI**. Else, if the computer is configured
to start with **UEFI**, try to configure it to start with **legacy
BIOS**. To do so, try any of the following options if available:

   - Enable Legacy mode
   - Disable Secure boot
   - Enable CSM boot
   - Disable UEFI

1. Try to upgrade your BIOS version.

Troubleshooting: Tails does not start entirely
----------------------------------------------

The following section applies if the **Boot Tails** appears but not
*Tails Greeter* when starting Tails.

1. In the graphical boot menu, press `TAB`.

2. Remove the `quiet` option from the boot command line.

3. Add the `debug` and `nosplash` option.

4. Hopefully, this displays useful messages while starting Tails. You can
   then include them in a bug report to be sent:

   - either using [[WhisperBack|/doc/first_steps/bug_reporting]] if you
     are able to start Tails from another media,
   - either by [[sending us an email|/support/talk]]

5. If the error message is `/bin/sh: can't access tty; job control
   turned off` followed by `(initramfs)`, then try removing the
   `live-media=removable` option.

   <div class="caution">

   <strong>When removing this option, if an adversary installed a fake
   Tails on an internal hard disk, then you will likely be starting
   this dangerous operating system instead of the genuine Tails that
   you intended to use.</strong>

   </div>

   If removing `live-media=removable` allows you to start Tails, please
   report a bug as documented above: this allows us to improve the [[list
   of problematic USB sticks|support/known_issues#problematic-usb-sticks]].
   In this case, you should install Tails on another, better supported
   USB stick.

Plug second USB stick
=====================

1. After the Tails desktop appears, plug the second USB stick into the computer.

<div class="caution">

<p>All the data on the installed device will be lost.</p>

USB stick.</p>

Configure persistence (optional)
================================

You can create a *persistent volume* in the remaining free space on the
device to store:

  - Your personal files and working documents
  - The software packages that you download and install in Tails
  - The configuration of the programs you use
  - Your encryption keys

The files in the persistent volume:

  - Remain available across separate working sessions.
  - Are encrypted using a passphrase of your choice.

Once the persistent volume is created, you can choose to activate it or not
each time you start Tails.

How to use the persistent volume
--------------------------------
