[[!meta title="Tails report for March, 2015"]]

March was full of surprises: first Mozilla changed the release date for Firefox, so the Tor team had to change the release date for Tor Browser Bundle, and we had to change the release date of version 1.3.1. Usually, those things get late... but this time, it has been advanced one week earlier!

But then... a whole bunch of vulnerabilities were discovered in Firefox, so they did an emergency release, and we had to release 1.3.1 early as well. And the planned 1.3.1 became 1.3.2. So, instead of a release-free month, we had a two-releases month!

Despite the hectic changes of plans, we did some good work. And for starters, a bit of recursivity: in March, we... published the [[two|news/report_end_of_2014]] [[previous|news/report_2015_01-02]] reports ;)

The two releases of this month were minor. They fixed security issues, but there was no major user-visible change. For details, see each release announcement.

We see a lot of users still confused with how to save files from the Browser, so [[here's the link|https://tails.boum.org/doc/anonymous_internet/Tor_Browser#index1h1]] if you also have the problem :)

=========================

* We explained why users [[shouldn't update Tails using `apt-get` or <span class="application">Synaptic</span>|support/faq#index8h2]].

* We explained how to [[install additional software|doc/advanced_topics/additional_software]].

* We mentioned I2P in our [[About|about]] page.
