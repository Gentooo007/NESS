[[!meta title="Tails report for March, 2015"]]

March was full of surprises: Mozilla changed the release date for Firefox, so the Tor team had to change the release date for Tor Browser Bundle, and we had to change the release date of version 1.3.1. Usually, those things get late... but this time, it has been advanced one week earlier!

Even with less time than planned, we did some good work. And for starters, a bit a recursivity: in March, we... published the [[two|news/report_end_of_2014]] [[previous|news/report_2015_01-02]] reports ;)
