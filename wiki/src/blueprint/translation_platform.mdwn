[[!meta title="Translation platform"]]

Our (website) translation infrastructure has a pretty high barrier for
new translators, especially those who are not familiar with Git and/or
the command line.

https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/9049

MUST
====
* integrate with Git (push and pull)
* provide a usable easy web interface

SHOULD
======
* provide support for Git branches (we could also agree upon translation
only master through this interface)
* should provide checks for inconsistent translations
* provide user roles (admin, reviewer, translator)

MAY
===
* provide context of the translation
* provide glossary feature
* send email notifications
* respect authorship (different committers?)
